# Graz BCI Conference 2024 Workshop 3: Navigating the latest advancements in c-VEP BCI: From experimental paradigms to decoding techniques

The goal of this workshop is to provide both theoretical as well as practical information on the latest developments of BCIs that use the code-modulated visual evoked potential (c-VEP) as measured by EEG. This workshop promises a comprehensive overview and hands-on exploration of both sophisticated experimental paradigms as well as cutting-edge decoding methods, both leading to higher performance as well as higher user-acceptance of the c-VEP BCI system. The workshop will start with an introduction to c-VEP, followed by an in-depth discussion of current developments in c-VEP experimental paradigms including burst codes, non-binary codes, and a novel auditory paradigm. The focus will then shift to decoding techniques, including trial-level prediction and zero-training, bitwise decoding using deep learning, and decoding using a Riemanian pipeline and deep learning. Finally, the workshop will conclude with interactive live c-VEP BCI demos featuring 'flickers on top' in combination with 'Timeflux', 'Medusa BCI', and ‘PyntBCI’.
